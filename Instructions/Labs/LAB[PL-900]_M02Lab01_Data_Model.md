# Lab 1: Data Modeling

## Scenario

Bellows College is an educational organization with multiple buildings on
campus. Campus visits are currently recorded in paper journals. The information is not captured consistently, and there are no means to collect and analyze data about the visits across the entire campus.

Campus administration would like to modernize their visitor registration system where access to the buildings is controlled by security personnel and all visits are required to be pre-registered and recorded by their hosts.

Throughout this course, you will build applications and perform automation to enable the Bellows College administration and security personnel to manage and control access to the buildings on campus.

In this lab you will access your environment, create a Microsoft Dataverse database. You will also create a data model to support the following requirements:

- R1 – Track information for scheduled campus visits

- R2 – Record basic information to identify and track the visitors

- R3 – Schedule, record, and manage visits

Finally, you will import sample data into Microsoft Dataverse.


## High-level lab steps

To prepare your learning environments you will:

- Refer to the following image for the metadata description (tables and relationships).

  ![data model document](../../Allfiles/CampusManagement.png)
- Create Visit table
- Import Visit data using an Excel spreadsheet

## Prerequisites

- Completion of **Lab 0 - Validate lab environment**

## Things to consider before you begin:

- Naming conventions - type names carefully.


## Exercise 1: Create New Table

**Objective:** In this exercise, you will create new custom table for Visits.


### Task 1: Create Visit Table and Columns

The **Visit** table will contain information about the campus visits including the visitor, scheduled times and actual times of each visit.

We would like to assign each visit a unique number that can be easily entered and interpreted by a visitor when asked during the visit check-in process.

> We use **Time zone independent** behavior to record date and time information, because time of a visit is always local to the location of the  building and should not change when viewed from a different time zone.
